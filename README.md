<p>This'll be my first project for "The Odin Project".<br>
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)<br>
Hopefully I'll learn something, yes?</p>



<p>Skills as of now:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>General HTML & CSS</li>
		<li>Getting the hang of Dev Tools in the web-browser. Still can't decide to use Chromium or FirefoxDev</li>
	</ul>
