This'll be my first project for "The Odin Project".
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
Hopefully I'll learn something, yes?



Skills as of now:
	*General HTML & CSS
	*Getting the hang of Dev Tools in the web-browser. Still can't decide to use Chromium or FirefoxDev
